## Shanghai/Capella upgrade
- Zhejiang public testnet
    - Resources: [links](https://zhejiang.ethpandaops.io/), [explorer](https://zhejiang.beaconcha.in/), [faucet](https://faucet.zhejiang.ethpandaops.io/), etc.
    - Fully open, and everyone can request test ETH and sign-up their own validators
    - Now have 61544 active validators (most from EF), which can see [here](https://zhejiang.beaconcha.in/)

- The roadmap
    - ‚úÖ Feb 1: launched Zhejiang public testnet
    - üîú Feb 7: activating Shanghai upgrade on Zhejiang
    - üîú Feb 9: decide when to active Shanghai upgrade on Sepolia testnet (next ACD-C call)
    - üîú late Feb or early March: activating Shanghai upgrade on Goerli testnet
    - üîú mid-March: Shanghai upgrade on mainnet
## Execution-Layer Specifications
- New JASON-RPC endpoint
    - [PR](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/329), [code](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/329/files)
    - The test
        ```json!
        {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"method":"eth_getAccount","params":["0xaa00000000000000000000000000000000000000","latest"]}

        {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":10,"result": { "codeHash": "0xce92c756baff35fa740c3557c1a971fd24d2d35b7c8e067880d50cd86bb0bc99", "storageRoot": "0x8afc95b7d18a226944b9c2070b6bda1c3a36afcc3730429d47579c94b9fe5850", "balance": "0x1", "nonce": "0x1"}}
        ```
- Transition from RLP to SSZ
    - üî• Vitalik's proposal: [Proposed transaction SSZ refactoring for Cancun](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/transaction_ssz_refactoring)
    - EIP draft: [SSZ transactions, receipts, and withdrawals](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6404/files#diff-a5425f21f2cd6d8408b1a73dd0a29ecfd0a132b3e62f8b111cd8a7b82b697b13)
## Other major upgrades (EIP-4844 only)
- Gas pricing
    - imapp's benchmark: [ script and data](https://github.com/imapp-pl/benchmarking/tree/precompiles_benchmark/shanghai)
    - conclusion: `50000 gas` (the proposed gas price for 4844 precompile) is reasonable
- Blob/Block coupling for sync & gossip
    - Pros üëç
        - The separation of blob data and block data helps to communicate more effectively/parallel
        - Make room for erasure coding and data availability sampling (DAS) of full-danksharding
    - Cons üöß
        - Increased complexity (short term)
        - And may affect some blob-verification cryptographic libraries (under checking)
    - Design ([new](https://hackmd.io/cmYisgxkRuGe9NjX4gr97A?view), [old](https://notes.ethereum.org/RLOGb1hYQ0aWt3hcVgzhgQ))
- Discussion
    - blobless 4844 transactions, transaction validity rules, transaction pool testing, etc.
    - Focus: whether to allow blobless 4844 transactions
