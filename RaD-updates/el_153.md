## Shanghai/Capella upgrade
- Beacon Chain Withdrawal
    - What is Shanghai/Capella upgrade
        - [Shanghai and Capella](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/shanghai.md) are the names of the upcoming Ethereum hard fork
        - **Shanghai** is the name of the fork on the execution client side, and **Capella** is the upgrade name on the consensus layer client side
    - What is Beacon Chain Withdrawal
        - Currently becoming a validator of Ethereum needs to lock 32ETH on the Beacon Chain, where all consensus-related logic is processed
        - Withdrawal will allow the validator to unlock and exit the Beacon Chain with the reward. This is one of the major functions in Shanghai upgrade
    - Updates
        - ðŸ”¥ [Withdrawals FAQ document](https://notes.ethereum.org/@launchpad/withdrawals-faq#)
- Devnets & Testing
    - devnet-3
        - Used to test the withdrawal function, which is currently running stably
        - Reference links
            - [Devnet-3 client spec](https://notes.ethereum.org/@bbusa/withdrawal-devnet-3)
        - Specifications
            - [CL spec: Alpine Ibex](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc.1)
            - [EL spec: EIP-4895 using units of Gwei](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6325/files)
            - [Engine-API spec: unify failure mode for mismatched structure versions](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/commit/939255f467f9c5700a65426159afdfc0e0a66060)
    - devnet-4
        - It is being launched, there is not much information for now
        - Will run mainnet-level validators for testing (`50w - 60w`)
- Shadow forks
    - [What is shadow fork](https://github.com/timbeiko/eth-roadmap-faq#shadow-forking)
    - Launched a shadow fork of Sepolia public testnet in 1.19
- Roadmap
    - âœ… Shadow fork of public testnet
    - ðŸ”œ Shadow fork of mainnet (**[is happening](https://twitter.com/vdWijden/status/1617530244302532615?s=20&t=22U9YImfwup79-3dakHqvQ)**)
    - ðŸ”œ Shanghai hardfork (**TBD**)
## Execution-Layer Specifications
- Gwei
    - EL uses `wei`, CL uses `gwei` (10^9 wei)
    - Change the specification, use `gwei` uniformly in EL and Engine API (consistent with CL)
    - [EIP-4895: CL-EL withdrawals harmonization: using units of Gwei](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/6325/files)
- SSZ
    - EL uses [`RLP`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/rlp/) to encode, CL uses [`SSZ`](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/ssz/#how-does-ssz-work) to encode
    - Etan (from Niubus) will draft an EIP to change all EL consensus-related encoding to `SSZ`
## Other major upgrades
- EOF
    - What is EOF, see [my article](https://hackmd.io/gvQNoH7fRnqiW2X6X31ZMg?view#EOF)
    - Last ACD call decided to remove EOF from Shanghai scope
    - This ACD call decided to include EOF into [Cancun's CFI](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/cancun.md#eips-considered-for-inclusion) (considered for inclusion)
- [EIP-6049: Deprecate SELFDESTRUCT](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6049)
    - Documents: [pragmatic destruction of SELFDESTRUCT](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/selfdestruct)
    - Included EIP-6049 into [Shanghai scope](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/blob/master/network-upgrades/mainnet-upgrades/shanghai.md#included-eips)
    - More: [EIP-6190: Verkle-compatible SELFDESTRUCT](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6190)

    - **ACD call** and **client teams** are still the ones who make the final decision, but this proposal hopes to bring the wider community into the discussion
